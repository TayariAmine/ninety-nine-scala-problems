Solutions and tests for Werner Hett's 99 problems in Scala (http://aperiodic.net/phil/scala/s-99/). The tests are slightly more comprehensive than the other tests I've seen the same problems on github, but they're still very weak.

I'm not sure I'll finish these. I was hoping they'd be a challenge, after doing Odersky's Functional Programming in Scala class, but they seem to be pretty straightforward so far (up to problem 41).
